# Detecting shifts in collective behavior in online groups
_Main author: Maris Sala_

_Done as a project related to [AU DATALAB](https://datalab.au.dk/)_

This codebase includes codes developed to study tipping points in online social groups, specifically in Danish Facebook groups, with an option to expand that to include subreddits on Reddit.
The analysis uses change point detection and Markov models.

## To use the codes
You'll need [newsFluxus](https://github.com/AU-DATALAB/newsFluxus) codes for getting novelty-resonance out.

The basic pipeline looks something like this, given that the codes are run from the root folder:
```shell
python3 src/get_data_specs.py
python3 src/main.py
python3 src/hmm.py
```
``main.py`` generates the LDA outputs that are then used by ``hmm.py`` to detect the Markov states and change points. Results are stored in ``out/``.
